# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a new Vue Project to rank stocks. Add a input to upload a CSV file and display it as a table in the html.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled because the table was not updating after processing the file, then I realized I wasn't using arrow functions!

### Day 1: July 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Ranked stocks by roi and ev/ebit. Disabled rows if roic is negative or is liquid margin is < 10.

**Thoughts:** Still studying if this is the best method, but now I already have a direction.
