# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a new Vue Project to rank stocks. Add a input to upload a CSV file and display it as a table in the html.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled because the table was not updating after processing the file, then I realized I wasn't using arrow functions!

### Day 3: July 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I made a HUGEEEE progress, I'm so happy! I've learned web scrapping (with cheerio) to get some stock data from sites and I've used express to create my REST API!! Now my frontend can consume the api to get some data! Now I can calculate the intrinsic value! 

**Thoughts:** Verry happy, made a lot of progress today!
