# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a new Vue Project to rank stocks. Add a input to upload a CSV file and display it as a table in the html.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled because the table was not updating after processing the file, then I realized I wasn't using arrow functions!
